\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This is the documentation for the \verb=tableofequations= package. It describes how to make a table of important equations, marked throughout the text with \verb=\markequation= and printed with \verb=\printtableofequations=

\section{Commands}
\label{sec:commands}

\verb=\markequation= takes two arguments, the first being the equation to mark (i.e.\ the math which will appear in the table) and the second is the physical label which appears wherever \verb=\markequation= is placed.\footnote{The placement of this label is the page referenced in the table of equations, so it's worth checking the label is on the same page as the equation!} E.g.\  
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0
\end{equation}
\markequation{e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0}{Euler's Equation}
is created by the code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0
\end{equation}
\markequation{e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0}{Euler's Equation}
\end{verbatim}

The second command defined by this package is the \verb=\printtableofequations=. Note that this command will always start on a new page, and force a new page when done. This command is demonstrated in section \ref{sec:table-equat-example}.

To redefine the title of table equations use \verb=\renewcommand= on \verb=\toeheading=. E.g.
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand\toeheading{Equations to Remember}
\end{verbatim}

To define the style of labels in the text, redefine \verb=\equationlabel=. E.g.
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand\equationlabel[1]{%
  \parbox{\linewidth}{\itshape\dotfill#1\dotfill}%
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Additional Notes}
\label{sec:additional-notes}

There are a couple of caveats of using this package
\begin{itemize}
\item Text/math inside \verb=\markequation= is fragile like a figure caption, so needs \verb=\protect=ing appropriately.
\item The LaTeX file will need to be compiled twice for any changes to appear in the table of equations
\item The table of equations is actually a collection of \verb=parbox=s arranged like a table. This shouldn't affect anything that I can see, but if you're debugging your file, you should remember that when looking through the errors.
\end{itemize}
